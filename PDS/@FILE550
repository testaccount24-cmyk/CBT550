//***FILE 550 is the Structured Assembler Macros collection from    *   FILE 550
//*           Dan Snyder.  If you have been tempted to use the      *   FILE 550
//*           IBM HLASM Toolkit set of structured macros, but you   *   FILE 550
//*           were afraid that you'd have to assemble your code     *   FILE 550
//*           in a place that wasn't licensed for the Toolkit,      *   FILE 550
//*           then you might try these macros as an alternative.    *   FILE 550
//*                                                                 *   FILE 550
//*           These macros (IF, DO, etc) are not interchangeable    *   FILE 550
//*           with the IBM macros from the HLASM toolkit.  You      *   FILE 550
//*           either use ALL THESE, or ALL THEIRS, but don't mix    *   FILE 550
//*           them....                                              *   FILE 550

//*           The advantage of using this set of structured macros  *   FILE 550
//*           is that they are FREE and that they offer a powerful  *   FILE 550
//*           method of nesting conditions. You can assemble with   *   FILE 550
//*           them at any site....                                  *   FILE 550

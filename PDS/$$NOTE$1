When I was in the process of making this macro package work, I
needed a way to combine OR clauses together and them have them
relate as a group to an AND.  In COBOL a programmer can do it by
nesting clauses within pairs of parentheses, so that's what I did
with this package.

The first character of a conditional phrase must be a '(',
indicating the presence of subparameters.  If the second
character is another '(', then that implies the possibility of
nested conditions.  The IF macro then splits the one or more
conditional phrases contained within the double parentheses into
individual parameters which are then passed to a recursive call
of the IF macro itself.  If you code:

        IF      ((((((((CLC,FIELDA,FIELDB,E)))))))),THENDO

then IF will call itself recursively 7 times (note the macro
level expressed in the line number field):

          IF    ((((((((CLC,FIELDA,FIELDB,E)))))))),THENDO
+         CLC   FIELDA,FIELDB       TWO OPERANDS - SET CONDITION CODE  08-000115
+         JNE   $MDF0013            B AROUND IF-GROUP IF FALSE         01-000198
            MVC   FIELDA,FIELDC
          ENDIF ,
+$MDF0013 DC    0H'0'               DEFINE END OF DO-GROUP             03-000330

Cool, isn't it?
